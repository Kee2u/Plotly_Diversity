# Belly Button Diversity

Rosa is a microbiologist who is interested in bacterial species that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered with a startup to research candidate species. She has a hypothesis that bacteria found in Human belly buttons have the ability to synthesize the proteins she needs.

## Project

I have created a web visualization dashboard using javascript, plotly, bootstrap and html that shows information on bacteria types found in the belly buttons of different candidates. A user choses the candidate they want to examine and the charts that correspond to that candidate appear:

 - A scatter plot shows a distribution of the different types of bacteria cultures found. Moving your cursor over the bubbles will reveal more information.
 - A bar chart shows the top 10 bacteria cultures found. Moving your cursor over the bars will reveal more information.
 - A gauge chart shows belly button washing frequency.
